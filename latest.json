We will start this very simple for now since it\u2019s the introduction of the  Leaderboards feature, but in the future you can expect us to set up different kinds of rewards.\n The  Leaderboard  Event starts today at 12  U T C and ends on the 12th of  December at 12  U T C. Throw yourself into the  Sulfurous  Wetlands and beat it as fast as possible!  It doesn\u2019t matter if you are using a regular character or a seasonal one.\u00a0  Additionally all players will gain 1.5  X P and  Loot from the  Dungeon.\n Let\u2019s have a look at the prizes.\n Rank 1 \u2013 99\n\n Chibi  Heart of the  Wetlands  Pet  Skin\n\u201c The  Sulfurous  Speedster\u201d  Title\n\n Rank 100 \u2013 999\u00a0\n\n\u201c The  Sulfurous  Speedster\u201d  Title\n\n How does it work?\n For those of you wondering how time is tracked for a  Leaderboard, it works like this.  Please bear in mind we are still fine tuning this feature so the implementation is subject to changes later.\n\n Whenever a new dungeon is opened and the first player \u201centers\u201d it, an internal timer starts.\n The timer stops when the main boss is killed.\n That time elapsed will be added to the score of all players present in the dungeon at that moment, but only if it\u2019s their personal best.\n If you are outside the dungeon/killed at that moment, it doesn\u2019t count.\n\n The system allows you to play as much as you want in the dungeon with any groups or solo, ensuring only your personal best is the one that counts for your ranking position.\u00a0\n Remember we might add additional rules on top of this depending on the configuration of the event, like  Leaderboards restricted to \u201csolo\u201d dungeons and such.  In all cases we will always respect the \u201cpersonal best is what defines your score\u201d rule.\n In a  Leaderboard, your score will appear as \u201c N/ A\u201d if your score hasn\u2019t been correctly registered.  This is because you don\u2019t have a \u201cpersonal best\u201d yet!\n A note of interest is that the  Leaderboards by design do not track if you get out and then back in to the dungeon, so while the portal is open you have a small time window to nexus and reenter, but you need to get back before it closes and the boss is killed or the timer won\u2019t register you.  Remember again the timer starts as soon as the first player enters the dungeon!\n We hope to read your feedback and impressions on the  Leaderboards system.\n",
